    <p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliiakravchenko/">Nataliia</a></p>
    <p> My IT path started 17 years ago when I studied in 5th grade. I was a student of profile class and we learnt programming and IT technologies from 5th grade and till the end of school education.</p> 
    <p>When I became a student of the university I continued to study programming. I have two diplomas of high educational: Physicist and Teacher of Physics; Specialist of Computer Science and Informational Technologies.
       While I was studying at the university I started to teach math. And I continued to do this after university too. But now I'm so excited to come back to programming.</p>
    <p>Now I'm a student again. I'm studying at "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Vu on Udemy. Also I have a mentor who leads me through the web development, gives me different tasks, checks my code.</p>
    <p>So soon I hope to become a great Frontend Developer</p>
